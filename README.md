# 👋 Hello there!

I'm a first-year IT student, just beginning my journey into tech — curious, motivated, and deeply interested in how things work beneath the surface.

🚀 Exploring areas like:
- 🛡️ Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking  
- 🌐 Full Stack Development  
- ⚙️ DevOps & Cloud Infrastructure  

🔍 Intellectually curious and always learning  
💡 Currently building a strong foundation for the future

This is just the beginning — the space may look quiet now, but it won’t stay that way for long. Stick around :)
